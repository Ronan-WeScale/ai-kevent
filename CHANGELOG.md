## Gateway

### [v0.4.8] — 2026-03-24

#### Fixed
- **Root cause of HTTP/2 INTERNAL_ERROR**: `applyDefaults()` checked `WriteTimeout == 0` and applied a 60 s default, silently overriding the `write_timeout: 0s` set in `config.yaml`. Go's HTTP server was killing every connection after 60 s — APISix received an abrupt close and sent `RST_STREAM INTERNAL_ERROR` to the client. Removed the default entirely: 0 = no server-level write timeout, which is correct for an inference gateway.

---

### [v0.4.7] — 2026-03-24

#### Fixed
- Remove `X-Accel-Buffering: no` response header. It triggered APISix streaming proxy mode which breaks APISix plugins (key-auth, response transforms) that need to read the full body — resulting in `curl (92) HTTP/2 stream INTERNAL_ERROR`. Keepalive `\n` writes every 20 s are sufficient to keep the upstream connection alive within `proxy_read_timeout`.

---

### [v0.4.6] — 2026-03-24

#### Fixed
- Sync-over-Kafka: delay HTTP stream commitment to first keepalive tick (20 s) instead of flushing immediately. Fast inferences (< 20 s) now return proper HTTP status codes (422, 504, 500). Long inferences commit the 200 on the first tick to prevent APISix/nginx idle-connection drops; errors after that go in the JSON body.
- All unit tests pass again (`TestSyncHandler_ClientDisconnect`, `TestSyncHandler_InferenceFailure`)

---

### [v0.4.5] — 2026-03-24

#### Fixed
- Sync-over-Kafka: send HTTP 200 + headers immediately on connection open, then write a JSON-whitespace newline every 20 s while waiting for the relay result. Prevents APISix/nginx from dropping the TCP connection during long inferences ("upstream prematurely closed connection while reading response header")
- Remove duplicate `Content-Type` header set at end of `handleMultipartViaKafka`

---

### [v0.4.4] — 2026-03-23

#### Added
- Extra form fields (e.g. `vad_parameters`) are now forwarded end-to-end in all modes: gateway collects non-reserved fields from the multipart form, stores them in `InputEvent.Params`, and the relay injects them into the multipart request sent to the inference API
- `Params` override `extra_fields` from relay config when both define the same key

---

### [v0.3.0] — 2026-03-13

#### Added
- Sync-over-Kafka: `POST /v1/*` multipart requests are now routed through a dedicated priority Kafka topic (`sync_topic`) instead of proxied directly, when `sync_topic` is configured for a service
- `internal/storage/redis.go`: `SubscribeJobDone` / `NotifyJobDone` for Redis pub/sub result notification
- `internal/kafka/consumer.go`: notifies sync waiters via pub/sub when a result arrives
- `SyncTopic` field in `ServiceConfig` and `service.Def`

#### Changed
- `SyncHandler` now requires `s3`, `redis`, and `producer` dependencies (sync-over-Kafka path)
- JSON requests (`/v1/chat/completions`) continue to use direct proxy regardless of `sync_topic`

---

### [v0.2.7] — 2026-03-13

#### Added
- Startup log indicating whether at-rest encryption is enabled (`"S3 storage initialised" encryption=true/false`)

---

### [v0.2.6] — 2026-03-12

#### Fixed
- S3 upload failing with `request stream is not seekable` when encryption is enabled — replaced `PutObject` with `s3manager.Uploader` (multipart) which handles non-seekable `io.Pipe` streams natively

#### Changed
- Removed provider-specific references (Scaleway) from log messages and code comments

---

### [v0.2.5] — 2026-03-11

#### Added
- AES-256-GCM at-rest encryption for S3 objects (`internal/crypto/aes.go`) — chunked streaming, no extra dependencies
- `encryption.key` config field; empty = encryption disabled
- `model` field in `POST /jobs/{service_type}` multipart body — selects inference backend when multiple models share a type
- `Job.Model` and `InputEvent.Model` fields in data model

#### Changed
- Job routes restructured: `POST /jobs/{service_type}`, `GET /jobs/{service_type}/{id}`
- `openai_path` (string) → `openai_paths` (list) — each model can expose multiple OpenAI-compatible paths
- `inference_url` is now a base URL; the original request path is appended at runtime
- Kafka topics renamed from `jobs.<type>.*` to `jobs.<model>.*`
- `registry.RouteAsync(serviceType, model)` replaces `registry.Route(serviceType)` — supports multi-model types
- `MaxFileSizeForType` used for `MaxBytesReader` before multipart parse (maximum across all models for the type)
- Docker image moved to `ghcr.io/ia-generative/kevent-ai/gateway`

### [v0.2.4] — 2026-01-XX

#### Added
- SASL/TLS Kafka authentication (`internal/kafka/auth.go`)
- `kafka.sasl` and `kafka.tls` config sections
- Fix: `buildTransport` returns typed nil — must not assign directly to `RoundTripper` interface

---

## Relay

### [v0.4.5] — 2026-03-30

#### Fixed
- Sync-direct requests (gateway in direct-proxy mode, no `syncTopic`) arriving on paths like `/v1/audio/transcriptions` were caught by the relay's `"/"` catch-all and rejected with 400 "missing job_id". KafkaSource always POSTs to exactly `"/"`, so any other path is now reverse-proxied transparently to the local inference model (`inference.base_url`).

---

### [v0.4.4] — 2026-03-24

#### Fixed
- Use `context.Background()` when publishing failure result events and deleting the input file after inference errors. Prevents silent loss of result notifications when the Knative request context is cancelled (e.g. `timeoutSeconds` exceeded), which would leave the gateway waiting indefinitely

---

### [v0.4.3] — 2026-03-23

#### Added
- `InputEvent.Params` forwarded into the multipart request to the inference API
- `Params` (from request) merged with `extra_fields` (from config), request params take precedence

---

### [v0.3.0] — 2026-03-13

#### Added
- `ServeHTTPSync` endpoint (`POST /sync`): priority CloudEvent handler that sets an in-pod `syncPriority` flag for the duration of the job
- `syncPriority atomic.Int32` field on `Relay`

#### Changed
- `ServeHTTP` (async handler): returns `503 Service Unavailable` when a sync job is in progress, causing KafkaSource to retry with backoff — giving sync jobs first access to the GPU
- Removed `SyncProxy` (`/v1/*` direct proxy): sync requests now arrive via the dedicated KafkaSource → `/sync` path

---

### [v0.2.7] — 2026-03-13

#### Added
- Startup log indicating whether at-rest encryption is enabled (`"S3 storage initialised" encryption=true/false`)

---

### [v0.2.6] — 2026-03-12

#### Fixed
- S3 upload failing with `request stream is not seekable` when encryption is enabled — replaced `PutObject` with `s3manager.Uploader` (multipart)

#### Changed
- Removed provider-specific references (Scaleway) from code comments

---

### [v0.2.5] — 2026-03-11

#### Added
- AES-256-GCM at-rest decryption/encryption for S3 downloads/uploads (`internal/crypto/aes.go`)
- `encryption.key` config field
- `InputEvent.Model` field support
- `result_topic` auto-derived from active model: `jobs.<model>.results` when left empty

#### Changed
- Docker image moved to `ghcr.io/ia-generative/kevent-ai/relay`

### [v0.2.4] — 2026-01-XX

#### Added
- SASL/TLS Kafka authentication (`internal/kafka/auth.go`)
- `KAFKA_SASL_USERNAME` / `KAFKA_SASL_PASSWORD` / `KAFKA_CA_CERT_PATH` env vars

---

## Helm chart (kevent-gateway)

### [0.2.2] — 2026-03-13
